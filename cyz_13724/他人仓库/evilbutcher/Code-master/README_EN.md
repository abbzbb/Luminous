6. Turn off iCloud Drive, and articles are stored in the script directory articles (can be packaged and shared); turn on iCloud Drive, and articles are stored in the JSBox/ArticlesHelper/articles directory.
7. The ArticlesHelper/download directory in iCloud is used to store the html records downloaded by Web of Science. Specific method: Safari downloads the Web of Science records in html format, after the download is complete, open the catalog, transfer to the ArticlesHelper/download folder, open the script, and parse the doi by loading the file. If there are multiple document records, load the last file by default doi. All records are saved in the ArticlesHelper/articles directory in txt format, and the analysis records can be managed by pull-down refresh on the document interface.
8. Windows users can download iCloud from the Microsoft Store for synchronization.
